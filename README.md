# ZK Usecases

I have explored and researched how Zk works and how it can solve real-life problems, especially for women. 

During my research, I had a brief discussion with two friends of mine trying to get their views about what they think of a system that allows people to prove that they meet certain requirements without revealing any other information. 

Then one of them made mention of a system whereby women can prove that they meet a certain age requirement to qualify for financial loans and opportunities without revealing any other personal information.

In some cases like where government are offering opportunities for women such as educational opportunities or financial grants, one of the requirements mostly requires them to meet a certain age requirement for qualification.
However most women are not comfortable sharing their actual age with people. This maybe due to situations where younger women have higher chances than the older women or other personal reasons.

This system can allow them to prove they meet the age requirement while keeping personal information like actual age, place of birth, and every other private information secret.
That way they can prove they meet the requirements and apply for such opportunities without sharing theor personal information.
